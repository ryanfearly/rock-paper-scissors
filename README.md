My first Javascript project!

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

Immediate reactions upon finishing:
- Fewer hiccups than exepcted - probably the only time in my life I will say that
- Really exciting to write for the browser, such a universal tool
- I LOVE the template strings in Javascript. So intuitive.

Future improvements
- Improve the scorekeeping at the end of the game. A little bit awkward that the DOM does not update.
- Refactor the event listeners

This was a lot of fun, and if anyone ever comes across this code and has feedback, please share it with me!
