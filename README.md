My first Javascript project!

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

Immediate reactions upon finishing:
- Fewer hiccups than exepcted
- Still struggling a bit with scope. I tried updating some global variables, but that did not seem to work well. More to learn.
- Really exciting to write for the browswer, such a universal tool
- I LOVE the template strings in Javascript. So intuitive.

This was a lot of fun, and if anyone ever comes across this code and has feedback, please share it with me!
